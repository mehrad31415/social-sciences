This project was done as part of the Research Methodology &amp; Statistics 101 course. 

### Research Question 1: How does conforming to gender norms impact being encountered by different types of verbal harassment? 
### Research Question 2: How does sex impact encountering different types of verbal harassment? 

To answer the research questions, a questionairre was created. 
We created the questionairre by peer-reviewing related articles and receiving advise from social science lecturers.
Furthermore, we set a deadline and a minimum number of participants. The questionnaire was open for 3 weeks and 205 participants (observations) were involved. Moreover, the questionnaire consisted of 57 variables.
The link to the questionnaire can be found in the files. These files only contain the R code for wrangling, tidying, and reforming the data. The variables have been modified and explanations behind each decision is provided.
Furthermore, multiple plots for interpretion are created and analyzed. Last but not least, Anova test and Chi-square test has been used to answer these questions.
Take note that this is only part of the project. The project contains many more variables and further analysis can be done.
